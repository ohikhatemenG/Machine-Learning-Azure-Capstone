# Machine-Learning-Azure-Capstone
This is a repository for Machine Learning Engineer for Azure Nanodegree
# The main Objective of this Project
The main objective of this project is to use the Azure Machine Learning Hyper Drive and AutoMl platform and capabilities to build a machine learning model and deploy the best model based based on the performance evaluation metric.

# Business Problem and Statement
Diabetes has being a common diseases affecting the globe in recent time. Many Health Institutions, Health Experts and Goverment have being engaging in research to come up with permanent cure for this but could not be able to do it. So I wanted to build a machine learning model with the  National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases data available and  diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes.
# Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease
I derived the dataset from Kaggle and the link can be found below.
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/diabetes.
# Dataset description
Pregnancy : Number Of Pregnacies happend
Glucose : Blood Glucose Levels
Blood Pressure : Blood Pressure Levels
Skin ThickNess : Triceps Skin Thickness
Insulin : Blood Insulin Levels
BMI :Body Mass Index
Diabetes :Diabetes Function
Age : Age Of Patient in Years
Outcome : 1 0r 0 to indicate whether a patient has diabetes or Not
# Machine Learning Model 
The data has lot of outliers, some have irrelavant values. All the preprocessing was done and placed in train.py using clean data function. After that I choose Logistic Regression Model to build as the Problem is binary problem and choosen accuracy as primary metric which needs to be maximised.
# Registered the Dataset on Azure
